polyHÃ©dronisme
===============

This is a project built to demonstrate the [Conway Polyhedral Operators][1] and their extensions by [George W. Hart][2]. It was heavily inspired by some [old code][3] of George Hart's that did much the same in VRML. Additional operators are being added to increase the range of procedurally generated forms possible.

One derives any of a vast family of polyhedral shapes by specifying a core geometric 'seed' and then modifying it with topological and geometrical operators that derive more complex shapes from this base set.

It should runs on any modern canvas-enabled browser. It was written in coffeescript.

Background
----------

This project was inspired by the renaissance tome [Perspectiva Corporum Regularium][4] featuring engravings by Jost Amman after designs and drawings by Wenzel Jamnitzer.

There are many core things to implement:
----------------------------------------
- implement proper 3d trackball rotations
- 3d export to OBJ, STL
- 2d export to SVG, PNG
