polyHÃ©dronisme
===============

This is a small toy built to demonstrate the [Conway Polyhedral Operators][1] and their extensions by [George W. Hart][2]. It was heavily inspired by some [old code][3] of George Hart's that did much the same in VRML.

One derives any of a vast family of polyhedral shapes by specifying a core geometric 'seed' and then modifying it with topological and geometrical operators that derive more complex shapes from this base set.

It should runs on any modern canvas-enabled browser. It was written in coffeescript.

So much to do
-------------
- implement proper 3d trackball rotations
- export to OBJ, STL files
